The States Parties to this Convention,
Considering that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United
Nations, recognition of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is
the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,
Recognizing that those rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person,
Considering the obligation of States under the Charter, in particular Article 55, to promote
universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms,
Having regard to article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 7 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which provide that no one shall be
subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
Having regard also to the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the
General Assembly on 9 December 1975,
Desiring to make more effective the struggle against torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world,
Have agreed as follows:
PART I

1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or
suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as
obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or
a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing
him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or
suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public
official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising
only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.

2. This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which
does or may contain provisions of wider application.
Article 2
1. Each State Party shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to
prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.
2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal
political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.
3. An order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification of
torture.
Article 3
1. No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where
there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to
torture.
2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall
take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the
State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.
Article 4
1. Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The
same shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and to an act by any person which constitutes
complicity or participation in torture. 2. Each State Party shall make these offences punishable
by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature.
Article 5
1. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over
the offences referred to in article 4 in the following cases:
(a) When the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship or
aircraft registered in that State;
(b) When the alleged offender is a national of that State;
(c) When the victim is a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate.
2. Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its
jurisdiction over such offences in cases where the alleged offender is present in any territory

under its jurisdiction and it does not extradite him pursuant to article 8 to any of the States
mentioned in paragraph I of this article.
3. This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with
internal law.
Article 6
1. Upon being satisfied, after an examination of information available to it, that the
circumstances so warrant, any State Party in whose territory a person alleged to have committed
any offence referred to in article 4 is present shall take him into custody or take other legal
measures to ensure his presence. The custody and other legal measures shall be as provided in
the law of that State but may be continued only for such time as is necessary to enable any
criminal or extradition proceedings to be instituted.
2. Such State shall immediately make a preliminary inquiry into the facts.
3. Any person in custody pursuant to paragraph I of this article shall be assisted in
communicating immediately with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he
is a national, or, if he is a stateless person, with the representative of the State where he usually
resides.
4. When a State, pursuant to this article, has taken a person into custody, it shall immediately
notify the States referred to in article 5, paragraph 1, of the fact that such person is in custody
and of the circumstances which warrant his detention. The State which makes the preliminary
inquiry contemplated in paragraph 2 of this article shall promptly report its findings to the said
States and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction.
Article 7
1. The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed
any offence referred to in article 4 is found shall in the cases contemplated in article 5, if it does
not extradite him, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.
2. These authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary
offence of a serious nature under the law of that State. In the cases referred to in article 5,
paragraph 2, the standards of evidence required for prosecution and conviction shall in no way be
less stringent than those which apply in the cases referred to in article 5, paragraph 1.
3. Any person regarding whom proceedings are brought in connection with any of the offences
referred to in article 4 shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings.
Article 8

1. The offences referred to in article 4 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in
any extradition treaty existing between States Parties. States Parties undertake to include such
offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them.
2. If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a
request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may
consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition in respect of such offences. Extradition
shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State.
3. States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall
recognize such offences as extraditable offences between themselves subject to the conditions
provided by the law of the requested State.
4. Such offences shall be treated, for the purpose of extradition between States Parties, as if they
had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territories of the
States required to establish their jurisdiction in accordance with article 5, paragraph 1.

criminal proceedings brought in respect of any of the offences referred to in article 4, including

and practices as well as arrangements for the custody and treatment of persons subjected to any
form of arrest, detention or imprisonment in any territory under its jurisdiction, with a view to

committed in any territory under its jurisdiction.
Article 13
Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in
any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and
impartially examined by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that the
complainant and witnesses are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a
consequence of his complaint or any evidence given.
Article 14
1. Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains
redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the means for
as full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of
torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation.
2. Nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim or other persons to compensation
which may exist under national law.
Article 15
Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a
result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person
accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.

cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined
in article I, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or
acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the
obligations contained in articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references
to torture of references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
